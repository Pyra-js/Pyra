# Installation

Get up and running with Pyra in under a minute.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 18.0.0 or higher (LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/) as your package manager

## Creating a New Project

The fastest way to start is with `create-pyra`, which scaffolds a full project and walks you through setup:

```bash
npm create pyra my-app
```

You'll be prompted to choose:

- **Framework** — React (full-stack SSR with file-based routing) or Vanilla (lightweight JS/TS)
- **Language** — TypeScript or JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** — optional, with preset choices

Once scaffolding is complete:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement.

## Initializing in an Existing Directory

If you already have a directory and want to set up Pyra inside it, use `pyra init`:

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npx pyrajs-cli init
```

This initializes the project in the current directory using the same template prompts.

## Installing the CLI Globally

If you work with Pyra across multiple projects, you can install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g pyrajs-cli
```

This gives you access to the `pyra` command anywhere:

```bash
pyra init
pyra dev
pyra build
pyra start
```

## Local Installation

For team projects, install Pyra as a local dev dependency so everyone uses the same version:

```bash
npm install -D pyrajs-cli pyrajs-core pyrajs-adapter-react pyrajs-shared
```

Then add scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "pyra dev",
    "build": "pyra build",
    "start": "pyra start"
  }
}
```
